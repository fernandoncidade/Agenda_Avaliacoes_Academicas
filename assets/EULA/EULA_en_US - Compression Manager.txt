By installing, copying or using the Software distributed as an executable, you agree to be bound by the terms of this License. If you do not agree to the terms of this License, do not install or use the Software.

1. DEFINITIONS
   "Licensor": Fernando Nillsson Cidade, the copyright holder of the Software.
   "Software": ACADEMIC ASSESSMENTS SCHEDULE — a graphical utility for managing academic assessment dates, including the distributed executable, embedded resources, and associated documentation.
   "Licensee" or "You": the natural or legal person who installs or uses the Software.

2. DISTRIBUTION ENVIRONMENT
   The Software is provided as an installer/executable for Windows. The end user does not need to install Python or additional libraries to run the Software; the dependencies listed in requirements.txt are packaged into the binary according to the build.

3. GRANT OF LICENSE
   Subject to the terms of this License, the Licensor grants the Licensee a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable and revocable license to use the Software according to the acquired license type (free or commercial).

4. USE RESTRICTIONS
   The Licensee shall not:
   a) Reproduce, distribute, sublicense, lease, rent, lend, sell or transfer the executable, except when authorized by a separate commercial agreement;
   b) Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or attempt to extract source code from the executable, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law;
   c) Remove or alter intellectual property or trademark notices contained in the Software;
   d) Use the Software for unlawful purposes or in violation of applicable regulations.

5. FEATURES AND DATA STORAGE
   - The Software stores user data and settings locally (for example, preference JSON files, activity lists, PDF exports) in the user's persistent directory (e.g., %APPDATA% on Windows).
   - There is no automatic transmission of data to external servers in the standard executable; any telemetry or synchronization integrations will be explicitly disclosed and require the user's consent.
   - The Software provides PDF export and other export routines depending on the build. Exported files are saved to the location chosen by the user.

6. THIRD-PARTY COMPONENTS
   - The Software may include third‑party components (e.g., PySide6, ReportLab, shiboken6, among others listed in requirements.txt). Those components are subject to their respective licenses.
   - Third-party license texts and notices are provided in the distribution package (NOTICE, LICENSES).

7. UPDATES AND SUPPORT
   - The Licensor may provide updates and fixes at its discretion. Support and update terms depend on the commercial license type where applicable.
   - Automatic updates, when included, will be described in the distribution documentation; the user may choose to accept or decline their installation.

8. LIMITED WARRANTY AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
   - The Software is provided "AS IS", without express or implied warranties, except for legal warranties that cannot be waived.
   - To the extent permitted by law, the Licensor shall not be liable for indirect, special, incidental, consequential damages or loss of profits arising from the use or inability to use the Software.
   - Where direct liability is legally recognized, compensation will be limited to the amount actually paid for the Software (if applicable) or BRL 5.00, whichever is greater.

9. PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION
   - The Licensor declares that the standard executable does not collect automatic telemetry. Personal data processed by the Software will be handled in accordance with applicable law (e.g., LGPD) and as described in the Privacy Policy included in the package (assets/PRIVACY_POLICY/Privacy_Policy_pt_BR.txt).
   - It is the responsibility of the user/organization to maintain backups of their data (exports, configuration files).

10. TERMINATION
    - This License may be terminated for breach of its terms. After termination, the Licensee must cease use and remove the executable as applicable.
    - In case of termination due to the Licensee's fault, amounts paid will not necessarily be refunded, unless otherwise agreed.

11. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION
    - This License shall be governed by Brazilian law.
    - For the resolution of disputes, the courts of the District of São José dos Pinhais, State of Paraná, Brazil, are chosen.

12. ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
    - Inclusion in digital stores or distribution adaptations may require additional conditions imposed by the respective distributors; such requirements do not automatically modify this License without written agreement.
    - Additional services (customization, integration, training) will be subject to a separate agreement.

13. ENTIRE AGREEMENT
    - This License, together with the Privacy Policy and third‑party licenses included in the installer, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Software.

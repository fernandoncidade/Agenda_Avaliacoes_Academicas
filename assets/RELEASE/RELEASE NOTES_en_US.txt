First public release — ACADEMIC ASSESSMENTS SCHEDULE

Summary:
This is the first public release of the Academic Assessments Schedule application, a lightweight graphical utility for Windows developed in Python with PySide6. Its purpose is to consolidate, organize and present dates of assessment activities (exams, assignments, presentations, etc.) in a single chronological view, with export and customization options.

Implemented:
- Registration of assessment activities with fields: course, syllabus, semester, subject, class, assessment type, sequence and date.
- Consolidated chronological view and automatic sorting by date.
- Color highlighting for quick identification of subjects/patterns.
- PDF export of activity lists (ReportLab).
- Individual and batch editing of entries; selective deletion.
- Persistence of preferences and local data in JSON in the user's directory (%APPDATA% on Windows).
- Multilingual interface (Portuguese pt_BR / English en_US) with runtime switching.
- "About" window with history, licenses, notices and privacy policy loaded from included resources.
- Prepared for packaging as a Windows executable (builds with PyInstaller supported).

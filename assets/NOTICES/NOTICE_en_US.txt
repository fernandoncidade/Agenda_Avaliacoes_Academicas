This document lists the main third‑party libraries and components used in the ACADEMIC ASSESSMENTS SCHEDULE project and provides references to their licenses. Its purpose is to meet distribution requirements and offer clear information to users, integrators and reviewers. Project dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file included in the repository/installer.

General notice

License handling and full texts
- Full license texts for third‑party components, copyright notices and any required notices are included in the distribution/installer package (LICENSE, LICENSES, NOTICE files or equivalent).
- If it is necessary to provide source code for components licensed under the LGPL (or similar licenses that require source availability), follow the instructions of each license — contact the author to coordinate provision of sources or relevant links.

Statement on data transmission and privacy
- The project's standard executable does not send automatic telemetry to external servers.
- All user data (for example, activity lists, preference JSON files, PDF exports) is stored locally in the user's persistent directory (for example, %APPDATA% on Windows).
- Any optional integrations that involve data transmission will be documented and will require explicit user consent.
- For details on personal data handling and privacy, consult the Privacy Policy included in the package (assets/PRIVACY_POLICY/Privacy_Policy_pt_BR.txt).

Notes on library replacement (when applicable)
- Dynamically linked libraries (e.g., PySide6 / Shiboken6) may, in specific builds, be replaced by compatible versions following packaging instructions. Replacement must comply with license obligations (for example, providing source when required by the LGPL).
- Any modification or replacement of libraries in distributed binaries must be accompanied by the necessary license notices and texts.
